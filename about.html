            <h1>Welcome to the Mystery</h1>
            <p class="story-text">"Secrets are shadows that cling to the mind, hidden from sight but never truly gone. They feed on fear and thrive in silence, growing heavier with each passing day. The horrors of secrets lie in their power to twist and contort reality, leading us to guard them at all costs, even as they erode our sanity. Over time, secrets can become prisons, trapping us within their walls as they whisper doubts and fears that burrow deep. They destroy trust, unravel lives, and haunt us in ways that even the most terrifying truths cannot. In the end, secrets are never just buried—they’re buried alive, always waiting to be unearthed, always lurking just beneath the surface, ready to claim their next victim."
            </p>With this website, I wanted to capture the essence of those haunting shadows in a short story about the dangers of secrets. I aimed to create a space for anyone who loves a spooky tale, especially during this season when we embrace the eerie and the unknown. The story centers around the unsettling atmosphere of Hollow Creek Motel—a place where secrets are not just hidden, but alive.<p> 

            </p> I have to admit, the final product you’re exploring now doesn’t entirely reflect what I initially envisioned. My mind was filled with ideas—much more ambitious and cooler than what you see here. However, I encountered challenges in execution, from technical hurdles to creative roadblocks, and at a certain point, I had to accept that my vision would remain unfinished. Despite my disappointment, I decided to release it anyway, because I’d rather share something imperfect than let stress consume me.
<p></p> So here it is—a simple, spooky story. It may not fully capture the depths of the horrors of secrets as I had hoped, but it’s here to offer a little thrill to anyone who dares to read.</p></p>
